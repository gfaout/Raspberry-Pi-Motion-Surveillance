# Raspberry-Pi-Motion-Surveillance
This repitory contains the work done in the summer of 2019 by Gautam Fotedar on a Raspberry Pi motion detection home security system

In order to run, after installing all dependencies, and entering "chmod +x security-camera" and "chmod +x security-camera.py", these two files must be placed in the same directory, and "./security-camera" must be run.  


 
Do be sure to download all dependencies beforehand.  

Much thanks and appreciation to Adrian Rosebrock of PyImageSearch, around which this project is based.
